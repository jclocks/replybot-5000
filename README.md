A simple bot written in Python3 that uses the PRAM library. Responds to certain key phrases from comments submitted in the r/AnarchyChess subreddit, and spams lyrics from a highly amusing video created by IM (International Chess Master) Levy Rozman on his Youtube channel, as a reply.

Inspired by u/FMHall's bot, u/PetrosianBot. That bot brought a lot of joy to the subreddit, so I figured why not add to the fun? Code was not derived from that Redditor's bot. The two are developed separately.

This bot is obviously open sourced and will be licensed under GPL v2. Feel free to fork and tweak to your heart's content as long as you abide by the licensing rules.
