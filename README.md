# REPLYBOT-5000: Beep Boop I am a Redditor ðŸ¤–

### What this is:
A simple bot written in Python 3 (https://www.python.org/) that uses the PRAW module (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to communicate with Reddit. Responds to certain key phrases from comments (post titles and comments planned for a future update) with a comment reply.

This was originally created as a reply bot for a subreddit, but was banned there. The project however was a success, so I want to continue refining this project to be as useful as possible.

This bot is open sourced and will be licensed under GPL v2. Feel free to fork and tweak to your heart's content as long as you abide by the licensing rules.
