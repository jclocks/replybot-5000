# REPLYBOT-5000: Beep Boop I am a Redditor ðŸ¤–

### What this is:

A simple bot written in Python 3 (https://www.python.org/) that uses the PRAW module (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to communicate with Reddit. Responds to certain key phrases from comments (post titles and comments planned for a future update) with a comment reply.

This code is pre-release, and it is not currently advised to use this for non-test use at this time. It _should_ work, but is not guaranteed to function as intended. Be sure to read the rules of the subreddit(s) you use this for, prior to use, as violating rules in a subreddit, or violating content policy on Reddit, can result in a subreddit or account ban respectively. If you are not sure if use of this code will cause issues, don't use it.

This bot is open sourced and will be licensed under GPL v2. Feel free to fork and tweak to your heart's content as long as you abide by the licensing rules.
